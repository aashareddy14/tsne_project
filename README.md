# Python Implementation of t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding


This is a Python implementation of the t-SNE algorithm as described in the paper Visualizing Data using t-SNE (Hinton and van der Maaten, 2008). This project was created by Madeleine Beckner and Aasha Reddy as a final project in the course STA663 in Spring of 2021.
