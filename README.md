# Python Implementation of t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding


This is a Python implementation of the t-SNE algorithm as described in the paper Visualizing Data using t-SNE (Hinton and van der Maaten, 2008). This project was created by Madeleine Beckner and Aasha Reddy as a final project in the course STA663 in Spring of 2021. We demonstrate accuracy and performance of our implementation through various applications to both real and simulated datasets, optimize the code, and compare this algorithm with other competing algorithms that address a similar problem.
